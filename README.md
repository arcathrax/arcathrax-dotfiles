# arcathrax-dotfiles

This is a repository of my MacOS configuration, to make my mac look like this:

The software configuration, that I'm using is:
- [yabai](https://github.com/koekeishiya/yabai)
- [SketchyBar](https://github.com/FelixKratz/SketchyBar)
- [skhd](https://github.com/koekeishiya/skhd)
- [JankyBorders](https://github.com/FelixKratz/JankyBorders)
- [yazi](https://github.com/sxyazi/yazi)

The SketchyBar setup is just a fork of [FelixKratz's dotfiles](https://github.com/FelixKratz/dotfiles). The yabai and skhd setup is based on [this](https://youtu.be/k94qImbFKWE?si=vV2tSKLrwlm36w3W) tutorial. Also I've disabled SIP (System Integrity Protection) for instant virtual desktop change.

## installation
Download this repository and run the `setup.sh`-file.
